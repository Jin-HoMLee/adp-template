    "Implementing routing in code involves defining the possible paths and the logic that decides which path to take. Frameworks like LangChain and LangGraph provide specific components and structures for this. LangGraph's state-based graph structure is particularly intuitive for visualizing and implementing routing logic.\n",

    "This code demonstrates a simple agent-like system using LangChain and Google's Generative AI. It sets up a \"coordinator\" that routes user requests to different simulated \"sub-agent\" handlers based on the request's intent (booking, information, or unclear). The system uses a language model to classify the request and then delegates it to the appropriate handler function, simulating a basic delegation pattern often seen in multi-agent architectures.\n",

The RunnableBranch checks the decision from the language model and directs the request data to either the booking_handler, info_handler, or unclear_handler. The coordinator_agent combines these components, first routing the request for a decision and then passing the request to the chosen handler. The final output is extracted from the handler's response. \n",
